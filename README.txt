Codebase for topological insulators research at Princeton Lab for Topological Quantum Matter and Advanced Spectroscopy 

Goals of research (3 - fold): 
    1. ML based magnetic and TI classifier
    2. novel RL-based crystal graph structure generative modelling for TI
    3. Mech Interp for such generative models and generalizing interp methodology to other vanilla inverse design algos for materials discovery
