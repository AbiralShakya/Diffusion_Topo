IMPORTANT: ensure you aren't on pytorch 2.6.0 as torchscatter is not supported

Compare logic  with generative topological insulators code with cdvae (btw this is very vanilla architecture) 
    compare this with magnetic prediction with atomic corodinates and look at shared latent space


Write novel RL based geneartive method 

Explore mech interp for this generative algorithm (another cool side project / paper)

High order topological insulators, non magnetic topological insulators (two proejects pretty much)
