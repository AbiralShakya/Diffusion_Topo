Electron electron interactions not studied much (is it relevant?)

Interesting computational experiment could be the model but with and without ? 
*read more on many body simulation regarding electron electron interaction for TI

notes from this nice paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.07816

overview:
    quantum many body problem
    entanglement built among lots of particles interacting with each other 
    hilbert space of solution grows exponentially with size of problem 

    quantum monte carlo method; densitymatrix renormalization group

    computational cost of exact diagonlization (ED) grows exponentially with system size

    tensory network methods (projected entagneld pari states (PEPS)) developed which can simulate fermoionic and frustated systems 



    deep learning methods for quantum many body problems 
        quantum spin model as example
            quantum many body state is represented by superposition of spin configurations 
            
            consider DOF on each site is k, hilbert space is k^N (for N total sites)

            weight of spin config is represented by NN &^ network parameters optimized to determine ground state of system 

            MCMC performed (lol lol). when collecting sample, the forward of NN gives local energy and backgard gives local derivative. 
            gradeitns and covariance matrix needed for Stochatic Reconfiguration (SR) optimization method are calculated 

            network params are updated. 


        *this paper is like from 2022 so lowkey kinda old for SOTA methods haha

        talks about RBMs (makes sense in regards to energy config, lol)

        their method: CNN 'optimized' for HPC

        transfer learning, local optimizations avoided and trainign steps for large lattice significatntly reduced
