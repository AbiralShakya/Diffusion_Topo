Diffusion model using comformer as coord system
    inverse design with invertible mapping 

symmetry aware models

later on consider many body hamiltonian (new research direction)

Adapted from https://arxiv.org/html/2406.09263v2#bib.bib39
and the comformer paper from my goats at TAMU 

high level design:

    1. jarvis + topological labels from MP structures
    2. Built PyG graphs 
    3. precompute angles fro comformerconv_edge

    1. turn atom types + z_c (property + topo + time), iniital node 
    2. denoiser: a stack of comformer block's instead of regular transformer 
    3. heads: predict the three + auxillary topo classifier I built

    1. loss: std diffusion loss
    2. lambda_topo * crossentropy(top_lotits, true_topo)

    1. conditioning to be figured out
