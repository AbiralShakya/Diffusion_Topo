## Introduction

This project aims to develop physically accurate generative machine learning models for studying and predicting topological insulators under perturbed electric fields. The system will combine state-of-the-art physics theory (including quantum Hall effect principles) with advanced diffusion-based generative models to simulate the transition between regular insulating states and topological conducting states. The computational framework will enable researchers to generate novel topological insulator configurations and predict their electronic transport properties under various electric field perturbations.
