TI, TSM, Trival topology inputs based on our classifier that we build (its an input)

target material properties 
    - crucial to integrate polarizability,  born tensors, and more

electric field parameters for pertubation analysis 
    field strength, direction, temperature

output: 
    atomic structure (unit cell lattice params, poscar file maybe?)

    predicted properties
        predictedd topoological classification (we want TI)
        magnetic state (and specifics)
        band structure and band gap under no field
        band structure and topological classification undder specified electric field

Specifically: 
    we are looking for electric field induced topological phase transition.
